# Binary Clock (numeric)
I made this little desklet as a fun lil project for myself. The goal was to learn about desklets, and improve by binary reading skills.

### Other Binary Clock
euxneks has a binary clock desklet which I discovered after creating this. It is a bit different though, that one uses small colored squares or circles to represent bits whereas this implementation utilizes alphanumeric characters. Use whichever you prefer :)
