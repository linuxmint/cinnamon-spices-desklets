   ```
2. **Enable** the desklet:

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Open desklet settings

## Configuration
The desklet uses a **settings-schema.json** file for easy customization:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `lastfm_user` | String | `""` | Your Last.fm username |
| `update_interval` | Number | `60` | How often to fetch updates (in seconds) |

  - Check that your Last.fm username is correctly set
