# Reporting Bugs

* It's important to use a proper title when opening new issues. The title must be in the format `spice name: simple description of the problem`.

Issues that don't follow this format will be closed.

You should mention the author on GitHub by typing @ plus his/her username to trigger a notification and bring his/her attention to an issue or pull request.
You find the username of the author on the cinnamon spices website: https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/

If possible tell us
* how exactly can we reproduce the error
* what you expected to happen
* what _actually_ happened
* whether the problem happens consistently or intermittently
* the version of Cinnamon and which Linux distro you are running

# Creating Pull Requests

* It's important to use a proper title in the **commit messages and pull requests**. The title must be in the format `spice name: simple description, what the commit/pull request does`.
* One Pull Request - One Desklet. This avoids the risk of having to revert changes to multiple desklets if any problem is subsequently found with the PR.  It also means that reviewing your changes is more straightforward.

Pull Requests that don't follow this format will be closed.
