Quote of the Day Cinnamon Desklet v0.3.0 - Oct. 30, 2016

This desklet displays a random quote of the day.  Left click it to display a new random quote at any time.


** Configuration options **
The following options are configurable via the Cinnamon Desklet GUI by right clicking "Quote of the Day desklet" and choosing Configure.

 	- Input file - see below for details on file format
	- How frequently to display a new quote, from once a minute to once a day
    - Font size
    - Font color
    - Font shadow (size, color, and blur)

By default, the font should come from the active theme.  However, changes to the font face can be made by editing the stylesheet.css file.  Add a line to the existing .quote-container element such as:
font-family:"Times New Roman";

Important: Cinnamon may need to be restarted and/or the desklet may need to be removed and re-added for this change to take effect. 

** Input file format **
The input file format is the same as that for the classic fortune (/usr/games/fortune) program.  See /usr/share/games/fortunes for examples.  The format is simply, "a text file with quotations, each separated by the character "%" on its own line," as explained on the Wikipedia page.  Whitespace formatting within the text file is preserved when the quote is displayed.


** TODO **
Provide a GUI method to change the font.

** Known Issues **
- When the desklet is added in Cinnamon 3.0+, the "Installed Desklets" screen shows a scary red exclaimation mark.  This is because Quote of the Day uses get_file_contents_utf8_sync to read the file of quotes, but this function was deprecated in Cinnamon 3.1  This warning will be fixable with the async version of this function, which should be available in Cinnamon 3.2.
- The text shadow may not be visible upon reboot until the mouse is hovered over the quote.  I'm unsure if this is an error in the desklet, or a problem with Cinnamon.


Comments welcome.
