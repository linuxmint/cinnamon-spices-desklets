## Usage

1. Add the Vaktija Desklet to your desktop via the "Add Desklets" menu.
2. The desklet will automatically fetch and display prayer times for the default location.
3. Configure the desklet’s settings, including location, appearance, and other preferences, through the settings menu. This allows you to customize the desklet to suit your needs and preferences.

## Configuration

Currently, the desklet supports 177 locations across Bosnia and Herzegovina and southern Serbia. Future versions will include additional configuration options and more locations.
The plan is also to add a notification pop-up system in future versions, as well as more locations.
