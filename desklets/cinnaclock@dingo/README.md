## Features

* Layered Design
* Typography Control and Advanced Positioning
* Format Flexibility: Supports standard strftime formats (e.g., `%H:%M`, `%A`, `%e %B %Y`).

## Customization
* The Time, Day, and Date layers are interchangeable and can be toggled on or off independently.
* You can create **different clock styles** by changing the positioning, font, size, color and shadow (horizontal/vertical offset, blur, and color).

## Configuration
Right-click the desklet and select *Configure*. You'll find four tabs:
* **General:** toggle visibility, set date/time formats, and adjust vertical positioning.
* **Time**, **Day** and **Date:** change font, color, uppercase mode, and shadow.

## Credits
This desklet is inspired by the *Modern Clock* (Prayag2) and *ClearClock* (qewer33) widgets for Plasma. Created with support from Gemini Ai.
