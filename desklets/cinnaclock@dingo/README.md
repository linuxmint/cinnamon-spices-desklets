## Features

## Customization
* You can customize, activate or deactivate layers independently.
* When selecting a preset, to update the values ​​in the configuration window, **close the window and reopen it**.
* For best viewing of presets, we recommend installing the following fonts: **Ubuntu** and **DSEG** (from the Application manager) **Maven Pro**, **Outfit**, **Poiret One**, **Roboto**, **Smooch** (from Google Fonts), and Anurati.

## Configuration
Right-click the desklet and select *Configure*. You'll find four tabs:
* **General:** toggle visibility, set date/time formats, and adjust vertical positioning.
* **Time**, **Day** and **Date:** change font, color, uppercase mode, and shadow.

## Credits
This desklet is inspired by the *Modern Clock* (Prayag2) and *ClearClock* (qewer33) widgets for Plasma. Created with support from Gemini Ai.
