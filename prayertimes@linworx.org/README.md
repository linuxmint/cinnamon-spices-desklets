# Muslim Prayer Times Desklet

## Overview

This desklet is used to display the 5 Islamic daily prayer times on your desktop.

## Configuration

The desklet attempts to detect your location automatically using the Internet.  However, the desklet can work offline completely if you choose to manually provide your location (latitude & longitude).  All the calculations are performed offline.

The desklet is fully customisable, allowing you to change the prayer calculation method, fine-tune prayer times & Hijri date, as well as change the apperance of the desklet.

You can also choose to disable individual components from the widget.  This includes the location/city, the count down to the next prayer, the entire prayer time table, and the Hijri date.

The desklet can be displayed in one of two modes: vertical layout (default) and horizontal layout.
