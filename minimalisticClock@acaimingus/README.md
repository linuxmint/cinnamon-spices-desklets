# Minimalistic Clock

This Desklet displays a simple minimal clock with hours and minutes.

I made this desklet because all the clock widgets I could find used the standard fonts, which I didn't like. I hope it works as intended and I hope you enjoy.

## Features

- Plug and play: Installs the font automatically
- 12 hour and 24 hour format
- Custom colors 
- Tries to scale itself properly according to display size
- Looks slick :D

## Possible Improvements

- Fix Container Size (The container is slightly larger than the widget itself, no effect on function but annoying, couldn't find fix)
- True Scaling (Positioning scales but the font size itself does not scale currently due to problems with St.Label)
