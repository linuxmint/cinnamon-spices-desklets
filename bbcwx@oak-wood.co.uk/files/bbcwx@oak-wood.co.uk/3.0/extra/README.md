There are lots of great icon sets out there that can be used with the
Weather Desklet, but which I can't distribute with the desklet. This 
may be because of license restriction, or simply because the 
distribution file is getting too large (there is a 10MB limit).

You can download alternative icon sets yourself and place them in the
`icons/user` directory, along with a suitably edited file namede 
`iconmeta.json`. For full details of the requirements see the 
[project wiki](https://github.com/tipichris/bbcwx/wiki/Using-your-own-icons)

This directory contains a collection of pre-configured `iconmeta.json` 
files that can be used with icon sets that are available to download. 
Simply download the icons from the location indicated in the README.md 
file, uncompress them and copy them to `icons\user`. Then copy the correct
`iconmeta.json` file to `icons\user`.
