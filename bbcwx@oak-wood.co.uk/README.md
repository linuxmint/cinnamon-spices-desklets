WEATHER
=======

The Weather desklet displays current and forecast weather on your Cinnamon
desktop. It has plenty of options for configuring how it looks and comes with
a selection of great weather icons, or you can use your own. For those who
like to keep an eye on the weather in several locations, it supports multiple
instances.

At present, the Weather Desklet can work with data from:

* BBC **{bbc}**
* meteoblue **{meteoblue}** *
* National Weather Service (USA Only) **{nws}**
* Open-Meteo Non-commercial **{openmeteo}**
* Open Weather Map Free **{owmfree}** *
* Open Weather Map **{owm}** *
* Weather API Free **{weatherapi}** *
* weatherstack **{weatherstack}** *
* World Weather Online **{wwo}** *
* Wunderground **{wunderground}** *

\* A valid API key is required for this service to work.

The Weather desklet includes translations for a growing number of languages.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Each service requires a valid location parameter and an API key where
required. A valid location parameter can take many forms:

* **Latitude and longitude:** You can provide a latitude and longitude. These
  should be decimals, separated by a comma, with positive being north or east.
  For example, to configure Central London as a location, located at 51.51N,
  0.13W, enter `51.51,-0.13`.
* **Location:** You can specify the location using City/Country or City,
  Country or City, Region, Country, where the region would be a state for the
  United States for example. Some valid examples: `Houston, TX`,
  `Paris/France`, `Chicago, IL, US`.
* **Location code/Station ID:** This is a location code that is specific to
  the service. To configure the desklet using one of these, you would need to
  visit the site (you can click using the link at the bottom of the desklet)
  and after searching for your desired location, the website address will have
  the location you can use. Some examples: `2643743`, `zmw:00000.16.03541`,
  `KMAHANOV10`.
* **Autodetection:** The location can be automatically determined by the
  service based on your IP address. Some examples: `auto:ip`, `fetch:ip`.

The location parameters per service:

* **BBC**
  * Location code
* **meteoblue**
  * Latitude and longitude (up to four decimals)
* **National Weather Service**
  * Latitude and longitude (up to four decimals)
* **Open-Meteo Non-commercial**

### REFRESH TIME

This option allows for setting the period between refreshing forecasts. The
default of 30 minutes should be adequate for most purposes. Please consider
the impact of lower refresh times on the service provider's servers and do not
use lower refresh periods unless you have a very good reason. In order to
comply with the terms of use of some providers, the Weather desklet will
override low settings in some cases and enforce a minimum.
