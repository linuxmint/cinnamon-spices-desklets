# Seven Segment Digital Clock

This desklet displays a seven segment digital clock. It also displays the date and/or the Unix time. The appearance of the output can be configured in a variety of ways. It's equipped with several styles of digits, which can be adjusted in format, color, opacity and size.

Since I use Cinnamon I missed this type of desklet clock, so I finally made it myself. It's basically my first desklet and there was a lot of trial and error, but here we are. I hope you like it.

## Requirements

Cinnamon 3.4 or higher

## Features

- Clock with 24h or 12h mode, the date and the Unix timestamp
- 20 different styles of seven segment digits
- Adjustable background, colors, opacities, sizes and formats
- Digits can be scaled up to 350 pixel in height.

## Known issues

After waking up from suspend mode the digits might get bonkers on certain machines. I don't know why. If this is the case double-click the desklet to recreate the graphics.
