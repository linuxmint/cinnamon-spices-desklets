# Google Calendar Desklet

Google Calendar Desklet displays your agenda based on your Google Calendar in Cinnamon desktop.

You can configure the every aspect of the desklet using the configure dialog in terms of selecting calendars and configuring the look and feel. However, the agenda is displayed using text so there can be any minor issues with alignments.

For the moment, the desklet has not been tested with different displays or aspect ratios so there can be issues with scaling.

## Requirements

 - `gcalcli`

## Installation

  1. Install `gcalcli` using the following command:
  ```
  sudo apt install gcalcli
  ```

  2. Launch `gcalcli` with a parameter listfrom terminal and configure the user account
  ```
  gcalcli list
  ```
  Once you have execute the above command, `gcalcli` will open a web page and ask you to provide the permission to access your Google Calendar.

  3. Run the following command with current date in terminal and see whether `gcalcli` prints your events
  ```
  gcalcli agenda "2/11/2018" "2/18/2018" --nostarted --tsv
  ```
  You should get an output similar to this:
  ```

  If not, your `gcalcli` has some issues. Without fixing them, Google Calendar Desklet cannot be used.
