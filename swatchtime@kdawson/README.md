This Cinnamon desklet displays the Swatch Internet Time in "beats". Swatch Internet Time is a decimal time concept introduced by the Swatch corporation in 1998. It divides the day into 1,000 "beats" instead of hours, minutes, and seconds. Each beat is equivalent to 1 minute and 26.4 seconds. The day starts at midnight BMT (Biel Mean Time, UTC+1).
