**TODO**:
 - Processes displayed in a grid.
 - User configuration options:
    - How often the update runs. Currently every 5 seconds.
    - Allow user to configure how many pid lines to display. Currently set to 10.
    - Allow user to set the top command. Currently set to `top -n 1 -b`.
    - Let user set the width and height of the desklet. Currently hard coded to 450px width.
 - Language Translations
    - I need to figure out how all this "po" stuff works.
    - Spanish (I may be able to bribe my co-worker Pablo into helping)
