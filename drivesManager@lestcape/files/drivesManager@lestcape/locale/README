Known bugs and requirements:
--------------
1- Warning! To use the temperature detection you need to have installed udisks2. The data of hdd temperature are obtained directly from udisks2. So you need ubuntu 12.10 or higher or an equivalent that come or allow install udisks2.

2- Be careful! When a removable device has more than one partition and is active the option to reconnect the device without removing from the connector. Can happen that you unplugged a device that have some partitions mounted and therefore you can lose some important data, so i fully recommend activate the option "Unmount all mounted belonging to the same drive". By default it's active.
