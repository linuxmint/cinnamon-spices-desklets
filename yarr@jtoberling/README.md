Experimental feature: Summarize with ChatGPT!

  Don't have time? Hate popups and adds? Just want to go quickly through
  the main news? 
  Use AI features to summarize the page - even with translation!

  Currently using ChatGPT so: 
  - Needs an API key:   https://platform.openai.com/api-keys 
  - Can cost money:    	https://platform.openai.com/usage

  Or just make it fun and convert it to Haiku! :)
  You can find example AI prompts in settings - and you can also write your
  own.
