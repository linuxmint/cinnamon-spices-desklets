# YARR Desklet Development Rules

## Critical Rules

1. NEVER restore old code versions without explicit user request
2. When user points to backup/reference code, it's for LEARNING, not for restoring
3. Keep all enhancements and improvements made - they are valuable work
4. NEVER consolidate modular code into one huge file - keep code organized and separated

## Module System Rules

1. Use require() for local module imports in Cinnamon desklets
2. Keep related functionality in separate modules:
   - database-managers.js: Database operations
   - async-managers.js: Async operations and timers
   - ui-components.js: UI dialogs and components
   - fromXML.js: XML parsing utility

## Code Organization Rules

1. Keep files focused and manageable:
   - Each file should have a single responsibility
   - Keep related code together
   - Don't mix concerns across files
2. Maintain proper exports in each module:
   - Export only what's needed
   - Use clear, consistent export patterns

## Enhancement Rules

1. Keep track of all improvements made
2. Don't lose enhancements when fixing bugs
3. Document major changes for future reference
4. Test thoroughly after any changes

## Backup Rules

1. Backups are for reference only
2. Never automatically restore from backup
3. Learn from backup code structure but keep current improvements

## Communication Rules

1. Ask for clarification when unsure about user's intent
2. Don't make assumptions about user's requests
3. Explain changes before making them
4. Be clear about what's being modified and why

## Error Handling Rules

1. Fix errors without losing improvements
2. Keep error handling code in place
3. Maintain proper logging
4. Don't remove error checks when fixing issues

Remember: KISS - Keep It Simple and Stupid

- Only do what user asks
- Don't invent complete new logic unless confirmed by user
- Don't overthink or overcomplicate solutions
