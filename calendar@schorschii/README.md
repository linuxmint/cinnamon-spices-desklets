# Calendar Desklet
A simple local calendar desklet that can display the number of today's appointments from an ical/ics file.

## Usage With Thunderbird
You can e.g. configure the Thunderbird calendar to save your appointments in an ics file.

1. Create an empty file on your computer, e.g. `/home/<username>/calendar.ics`.
2. Create a new calendar in Thunderbird using this file.
   - In the "New Calendar" dialog, choose "Network".
   - As address, enter the URL path to the file on your computer, e.g. `file:///home/<username>/calendar.ics`.
3. Choose the file in the desklet settings. The desklet will now display the number of today's appointments in the ics file.
